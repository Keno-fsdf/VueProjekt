# Vue Project

A book management system with Vue.js frontend and Flask backend.

## Features

- Manage books, authors, and publishers
- RESTful API for CRUD operations
- Vue.js frontend with component-based architecture
- MySQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x
- MySQL

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors sqlalchemy pymysql python-dotenv

# Set environment variables in .env file
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Run the backend
Make sure your MySQL database is running.
Use a MySQL client such as MySQL Workbench to connect, and enter your database username and password.
Simply accessing the database through the Python script is not enoughâ€”you need to ensure that the connection works and that you have the correct credentials by testing it in a MySQL client first.
python Backend.py
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```
